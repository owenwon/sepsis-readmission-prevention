Team PeaceHealth Informatics Capstone 2026

## Project Description
Our capstone project addresses the question: How might adult patients better track their risk for infection so that they can prevent readmission for sepsis? Sepsis survivors often leave the hospital physically weakened and cognitively overwhelmed, making it difficult to manage their own care during recovery. Critical post-discharge instructions are easy to lose or forget after a traumatic health event, especially when patients are eager to leave the hospital and return home. As a result, early warning signs of infection may go unnoticed, increasing the risk of complications and readmission. This project explores how improved tools and systems for tracking infection risk, paired with clearer, more retainable patient education, can support sepsis survivors during recovery and help reduce preventable hospital readmissions.
